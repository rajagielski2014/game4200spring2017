A list of stories: 

The other day, while playing with my dog outside, I threw her chew toy over the house and into the backyard. She couldn't underdtand the fact that I threw it into the backyard though, so she ran into the bushes in front of my house and ran around trying to find the toy until I went into the backyard and brought it to her.
